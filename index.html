			<p>If you are reading this summary about me, there will be a 50% chance you will laugh. But before I get to the funny stuff, let me tell you about my life. I am an eighteen-year-old web developer who was raised by strict traditional Filipino parents who wanted me to be a nurse... or a doctor... or a lawyer... or an engineer. However, I am not your normal eighteen-year-old (don't worry I'm not too weird either). During my senior year of high school, I was able to realize my passion in coding. At the time, I asked myself, "Do I really need to pay $100,000 to learn what I want to learn while being around a bunch of kids that went to college because they heard that they have the best parties?" Sounds absurd, right? I then asked my best friend, Google, about my problem, and he/she found the solution to it! It was called a coding boot-camp (not to mention, a much more affordable program than your traditional university/college with a greater time value of money and value of time itself). Needless to say, I didn't hesitate to apply to one of the boot-camps. Nowadays, I often reflect back on my time at General Assembly, and I can't help but say to myself, "Damn, I'm Samy Kamkar." </p>
